# Arduino-S-Expr-Test

An Arduino sketch used to test the [S-Expr](https://github.com/PIFAH/S-Expr) repo, which implements very simple S-Exprs for serial communications.

I don't know of a good way to do automated, X-Unit style testing on an Arduino.  I simply call my test functions and print "RED" or "GREEN".

Certainly, these tests are valuable as an example of how to use the code.

This is a very early version of this code.  If people find it valuable, it cannot no doubt be greatly improved.
